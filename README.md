# `seaborn-stuff`
This repository merely contains files in which I've been playing around with Seaborn. As such, most of the code in `seaborn-stuff.py` is commented out. 

The file `seaborn-stuff.py` allowed me to apply what I knew about Seaborn to simple data sets I found online. Some of the plots in this file may not even produce anything interesting when un-commented because the dataframe I was using was structured differently from the dataframe in the example I was referencing. 

All data sets come from [FiveThirtyEight's Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).
